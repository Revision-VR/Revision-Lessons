      thermosphere, ionosphere, exosphere.\r\nAlmost 71% of the surface of our planet
      is occupied by oceans.\r\nContinents contain rivers, lakes, groundwater and
      ice, which together with the world's oceans form the hydrosphere.\r\nOn land,
      mountains, deserts, plains, plateaus and other types of relief are distinguished.\r\nThe
      Earth's poles are covered by a crust that includes the Arctic sea ice and the
      Antarctic ice sheet.\r\nThe Earth was formed from the solar nebula about 4.5
      billion years ago, and it ranks first among the 8 planets in terms of lithosphere
      density.\r\nEarth's magnetic field is one of the strongest in the solar system
      and protects our planet from solar plasmas and harmful radiation.\r\n"

      and has an average radius of 1,738 km. On average, the sun goes around the
      earth once every 27.3 days, passing through all its phases.

      The surface
      of the forest consists of gray silicate sands, calcid dust, and metals such
      as iron, aluminum and titanium are found in the soil composition. its albedo,
      i.e. reflectivity, reflects only 7.3% of sunlight.

      Tulin Moon is 465,000
      times fainter than the Sun.

      Earth''s gravity slows down the game''s
      rotation around its axis. The period of one full rotation of the Moon around
      its axis is called the synodic Moon, and it is 30 days, so people see only
      one side of the Moon.

      The natural satellite of the Earth was observed
      for the first time in 1610 by Galileo through a telescope. In 1647, the first
      map of Moon was created.

      The topography consists of plains below the
      general level, buttes, ravines, craters left by the impact of mountains and
      meteorites.

      A new stage of exploration of the game begins with the meeting
      of interplanetary automatic stations in the game. A lot of information about
      the moon was obtained with the help of such devices as "Lunar Orbiter", "Surveyor",
      "Apollo" and Lunokhod.

      In 1969, the members of the Apollo 11 mission
      were able to successfully return from Earth''s natural satellite. Until 1972,
      five more expeditions to Moon were organized, and a total of 12 astronauts
      returned to the surface of Moon.

      Every 29 days, 12 hours and 44 minutes,
      the Full Moon occurs, and this cycle is called the Lunar Moon, and the Lunar
      Calendar was created based on this.'

      of large boulders or asteroids.\r\nMars has a thin atmosphere. According to
      scientists, in the distant past, the magnetic field of Mars weakened and lost
      a large part of the planet's atmosphere.\r\nThe Martian landscape consists
      of impact craters, volcanoes, valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps.\r\nAccording
      to NASA, the average temperature on the planet's surface is minus 60 degrees
      Celsius. Under the influence of sunlight, the surface temperature at the Martian
      equator can rise to plus 35 degrees. However, this warming loses its power
      as the sun's declination changes, and even on the hottest summer days for Mars,

      the group of ice giants. Currently, Uranus is known to have 27 natural moons.
      Around Uranus, particles consisting of a mixture of ice and an unknown substance
      move in several parallel orbits, forming rings like Saturn. However, it is
      this unknown substance that gives the rings of Uranus a dark color, making
      it difficult to see and study.

      Like the gas giants of the Solar System,
      Uranus has a strong magnetosphere. The average distance from Uranus to the
      Sun is 2.8 billion kilometers, which is 18.6 times greater than the distance
      between the Earth and the Sun.

      Uranus''s average orbital speed is 6.81
      kilometers per second, and the planet orbits the Sun approximately once every
      84 Earth years.

      Uranus is the coldest planet in the Solar System, with
      a minimum temperature of minus 224 degrees Celsius.

      "Voyager 2" found
      its own magnetic field in Uranus. The atmosphere of Uranus consists of hydrogen,
      helium and 3 percent methane, and the wind speed on the surface of the planet
      can reach 900 kilometers per hour.

      Uranus can be directly observed from
      the ground in a very clear and dark sky. It was discovered to be a planet in
      1781 by the English astronomer William Herschel. So far, Uranus has been observed
      21 times, but astronomers mistook it for a star.

      The planet Uranus was
      studied by the Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1986.

      The names of the moons
      of Uranus were chosen from the names of characters in the works of William
      Shakespeare and Alexander Pope.

      of this ice giant from the Sun is 4 billion 55 million kilometers, or 30.3
      astronomical units.

      Around Neptune there is a system of extremely thin
      rings of ice and silicon salts, which can only be seen with high-resolution
      telescopes.

      Like the gas giants of the Solar System, Neptune has a strong
      magnetosphere. The planet''s atmosphere is composed of hydrogen, helium, and
      methane, with a mantle composed of water, ammonia, and methane ice; has a rock
      and ice core.

      Neptune has a red ring system with 5 components.

      Neptune''s
      average orbital speed is nearly 5.5 kilometers per second, and the planet orbits
      the Sun approximately once every 165 Earth years.

      The temperature in
      the upper layer of the planet''s atmosphere, which consists of huge ice and
      gas, is -220 degrees. Neptune is 49,244 kilometers in diameter, 3.9 times the
      size of Earth, and the fourth largest planet in the Solar System.

      The
      average density of Neptune is 1.64 (1 whole, 64 hundredths) grams per cubic
      centimeter.

      The mass is 1.02 x 1026 (1 whole hundred times 2 times 10
      to the 26th power) in kilograms.

      Neptune''s atmosphere consists of hydrogen,
      helium and methane.

      Neptune''s atmosphere has some of the strongest
      winds of any planet in the Solar System, with speeds estimated to reach 2,100
      kilometers per hour.

      The weather on Neptune consists of a system of
      storms, with winds reaching speeds greater than the speed of sound.

      It
      is not possible to directly see the planet Neptune from the earth. Neptune
      was discovered by scientists of the Berlin Observatory in 1846 through mathematical
      calculations.

      Neptune was approached only once in August 1989 by the
      Voyager 2 spacecraft. Through observations in the radio wave range, it has
      been proven that the planet is exposed to constant radiation and constant explosions
      occur on its surface.

      Neptune can only be seen from Earth using special
      observation devices.

    m_Localized: "The heart is the central organ of the circulatory system consisting
      of muscle tissue. By contracting and relaxing in a certain rhythm, the heart
      ensures that blood is transported through the veins to the various organs.
      The human heart is four-chambered, consisting of two chambers and two ventricles.\r\n\rThe
      circulatory system is divided into small and large circulatory system.\r\nA
      small circle of blood circulation connects the heart and lungs . Venous blood
      saturated with carbon dioxide from the right ventricle of the heart goes to
      the lungs through two pulmonary veins, where it is separated into capillaries.
      Carbon dioxide is removed in the capillaries, and the blood is again saturated
      with oxygen. Oxygenated blood comes to the left side of the heart through the
      artery. In this way, 1 movement cycle of the small circulatory system is completed.\r\nThe
      large circulatory system starts from the large left ventricle of the heart.
      The left ventricle pumps oxygenated blood into the aorta. Oxygenated blood
      travels throughout the body from the aorta to the arteries.\r\nBlood passes
      through the increasingly smaller and branching veins into the capillaries.
      The capillary transports the blood to the desired point. In the capillary,
      it gives the oxygen contained in the blood to the cells, saturates them with
      carbon dioxide, turns into venous blood and comes to the right side of the
      heart through the veins. In this way, 1 cycle of the large circulatory system
      is completed.\r\nVenous blood passes through the heart valves from the right
      ventricle to the right ventricle, moves towards the lungs with the contraction
      of the ventricle, and begins to move along the aforementioned small blood circulation
      circle.\r\nIn order to maintain the vital activity of the body, blood is in
      constant motion within both circulations.\r\n"

      and expand under the influence of nerve impulses . \r\nThe muscular system
      is divided into smooth, transverse and cardiac muscles. A muscle cell has a
      long filamentous shape. Muscles need a good blood supply to function properly.
      Because of this, small blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, and sensory and motor
      nerve tissue pass between the muscle tissues.\r\nSmooth muscles are the muscles
      of internal organs, skin, blood vessels and lymphatic vessels, which move involuntarily.
      For example, the muscles of the stomach contract and ensure the movement of
      food towards the intestine.\r\n\rTransverse muscles extend from the tendons
      and, together with ligaments and fascia, help the body move. Cross-sectional
      muscles are connected to bones and bone joints and move voluntarily.\r\nThe
      heart muscle - the myocardium performs absorption and delivery of blood .\r\nMuscle
      strength depends on the number of muscle fibers - myofibrils. There are about
      600 muscles in the human body, which are controlled by the central nervous
      system.\r\nThe human body has the following muscles:\r\nHead:\r\nForehead muscles\r\nTemplar

    m_Localized: "The composition of the architectural complex in Registan square
      began with the construction of a madrasa according to the decree of Mirzo Ulug'bek.
      The madrasa was built in 1417-1420, and its level is 81x56 m. was the surrounding
      area.\r\nThe author of the building project was Qavamiddin Shirozi, a famous
      scientist of his time, and most of the architectural complexes built for rulers
      in Herat belonged to his work.\r\nUlugbek madrasah is a classic example of
      Eastern monuments as an architectural work. Of all the structures built in
      Registan in the 15th century, only the Mirzo Ulugbek madrasa has survived to
      us, even though it is somewhat in ruins. The madrasah was two-storied, had
      55 rooms and large classrooms and porches at the four corners. 2-3 students
      studied and lived in rooms designated for special education . Each room was
      used for reading, living, and storing things in a separate part. Science classes
      were held in classrooms for separate groups. The porches served as summer classrooms.
      There is a mosque between two classrooms on the west side. It had two doors
      connecting to the classroom and the courtyard.\r\nThe madrasah has a high gable.
      Its side walls are decorated with large geometric patterns.\r\nIn general,
      the madrasa is rich in patterns and has a wonderful unique appearance. The
      combination of plain brick and decorative bricks, examples of tiling and marble
      carving form a whole art. The colorful, star-like images in the paintings and
      the verses from the Holy Qur'an written in suls script are a sign that Mirza
      Ulugbek is a great scholar. The tall minarets at the four corners of the madrasa
      make the building look even more beautiful and dignified.\r\nThis madrasa,
      built by Ulugbek, was an advanced, excellent higher education institution of
      its time with all conditions, and gained great fame as the first medical institution
      in the East and a scientific institution with wide opportunities. At the same
      time, it became famous all over the world as the Ulugbek Academy.\r\nAs a proof
      of our opinion, it is enough to quote the following opinion of the famous European
      writer, philosopher and historian Voltaire (1694-1778): \"The famous Ulugbek,
      who succeeded him (Amir Temur) in Transoxiana, founded the first academy in
      Samarkand. participated in the compilation of astronomical tables.\"\r\nIn
      this academy, Mirzo Ulug'bek educated more than several hundred scientists.
      The world-famous Samarkand observatory has become a center for learning the
      secrets of the universe for teachers and students. In addition, Ulughbek's
      madrasahs in Bukhara and Gijduvan were also modern dorilfununs belonging to
      the academy in the capital.\r\n\rThere was a large library in the rooms on
      the second floor of the Ulugbek madrasa. Most of the books collected by the
      Great Amir Temur and his children are stored here. In-depth knowledge of all
      religious and secular subjects is well established in the Ulugbek madrasa.
      All conditions were created for the work of more than a hundred famous scientists
      of the time who taught in the madrasa. Ulug'bek himself had a direct conversation
      with the scientists and after being convinced of their scientific excellence,
      he allowed them to become teachers.\r\nAmong the famous scholars - Maulana
      Muhammad Havofi, Qazizada Rumi, Ghiyaziddin Jamshid, Mu'iniddin Koshi, were
      among the leading scholars and teachers of the madrasa. Along with other scientists,
      Ulugbek himself and his student Ali Kushchi taught various subjects in the
      madrasa.\r\nDetermining the sine of an arc of one degree, which led to an algebraic
      equation of the third degree, was one of the most remarkable and important
      achievements of Ulugbek and his school, while determining the coordinates of
      the places of residence, making a perfect star table containing 1018 stars,
      noting that the solar year consists of 365 days, 10 minutes, and 8 seconds.
      calculation (the error is only 0.58 seconds), the ecliptic's distance relative
      to the earth and the discovery of the movement of the seven planets introduced
      the Samarkand Academy to the world and attracted the attention of all representatives
      of science. As a result, Samarkand became the only center of exact sciences
      in the world.\r\nMadrasah education consisted of three stages: the first stage
      was the \"ando\" or \"low step\" elementary department; the second stage is
      \"avsat\" or \"miyona\", middle department, the third stage is \"excellent\"
      or \"high\" higher department. Talented students studied diligently for four
      to five years in each department. As a result, the student who studied at the
      madrasa, fully mastered the main subjects according to its program and was
      able to demonstrate his knowledge in the exam lessons, was given a \"Sanad\"
      (certificate). study and teaching in the madrasa is free, and expenses are
      covered by the property of the foundation.\r\nSome of the scholars who taught
      at the Ulughbek madrasa in Samarkand, along with teaching students in various
      subjects, also dealt with practical issues in mathematics, geography, geometry
      and astronomy. Before the observatory was built and put into operation, the
      work of observing the movement of celestial bodies was carried out, to a certain
      extent, in this madrasa and in the \"Muqatta'\" mosque built by Ulug'bek. World-famous
      scientists such as Miram Chalabi and Abul Ali Birjandi studied during these
      times.\r\nIn the 15th century, the fame of Samarkand as a center of science
      and literature was known throughout the Eastern world. Scholars and scholars
      from all over the world came to the city.\r\nAlisher Navoi, a great Uzbek thinker
      poet and public figure, who lived and studied in Samarkand in 1465-1469, also
      enriched his knowledge in astronomy, geography, history, and literary studies.
      The education he received at the Ulugbek madrasa for more than two years became
      important in his later life.\r\nHistorians Sharafuddin Ali Yazdi, Hafizi Abro',
      Abdurazzogi Samarkandi, Mirkhand, Khondamir, Isfahani, Davlatshah Samarkandi
      lived in this great city; Literary figures: Qutb, Sayfi Saraoi, Lutfi, Haidar,
      Khorazmi, Durbek, Amiri, Yaqini, Atoyi, Sakkoki and others grew up and created
      here. Abduqodir Naimi, Qulmuhammad Shatqi, Husayn Udi, Shahquli Gijjaki, Kasim
      Rabbani, Darvesh Ahmad Qonuni, Khoja Yusuf Andijani, Ustoz Shadi, Jamshid Tabli,
      and other representatives of music science. Mirak Naqqosh, Qasim Ali, Mahmud
      Muzahhib, Haji Muhammad Naqqosh and Shah Muzaffar are the masters of the brush.\r\nCalligraphers
      such as Mirali Tabrizi, Sultanali Mashhadi, Sultanali Khandon, and Halvoi Rafiqi
      are representatives of this era.\r\nThe Madrasa of Mirzo Ulugbek is one of
      the rarest monuments of Eastern architecture and rightfully a unique masterpiece
      of medieval Muslim architecture.\r"

    m_Localized: "The history of the city of Samarkand in the first half of the 17th
      century is closely related to the activities of Yalangtush Bahadir, a great
      representative of the Uzbek nobles who came from the ashtarkhanid dynasty.\r\nIn
      Samarkand, during the Ashtarkhanid period, due to the influence of Yalangtush
      Bahadir, the construction works were revived. On the direct initiative and
      decree of this enlightened and generous governor, repair work was carried out
      on the luxury Mirzo Ulugbek Madrasa in Registan Square, which was in ruins,
      and two luxurious buildings were built in place of the completely destroyed
      Mirzo Ulugbek's house, Mirzoyi bathhouse and caravan palaces - Sherdor Madrasah
      (1619-1636) and Tillakori madrasa-mosque (1646-1660) was built. Sherdor madrasa
      was built as a copy of Mirza Ulugbek madrasa on the place of the demolished
      15-meter-diameter large domed hall . The facade of the Sherdar madrasa is basically
      the same as the facade of the Mirzo Ulugbek madrasa, although the buildings
      are similar, but they differ in terms of quality and architecture.\r\n\rThe
      level of Sherdar madrasa is 70x57 meters, i.e. it is quadrangular in shape,
      the courtyard is surrounded by two-story rooms, their number is 52, classrooms
      are located in the corners of the courtyard. However, there is no mosque in
      this monument, and the southwestern classroom is considered a shrine, because
      it is directly adjacent to the mausoleum of the tomb of Imam Muhammad ibn Ja'fari
      Sadiq.\r\nThe minaret and domes on the facade of the Sherdor madrasa are similar
      to the Ulugbek madrasa, but the corners of the facades at the back are surrounded
      by minarets. By the 17th century, due to the rise of cultural layers, the ground
      level was raised by about two meters from the original ground level in the
      15th century. That is why it was built as a reduced form of Ulugbek madrasa,
      which looked a little lower. During the construction of the Sherdar madrasa,
      many innovations characteristic of 17th century architecture were used, advanced
      methods were used to speed up and make the construction process cheaper, but
      it is noticeable that the influence of artistic decorations has decreased somewhat.
      But the use of colors and the exquisite execution of some panels testify to
      the high skill of the architects and painters who created this monument.\r\nPatterns
      cover the entire obida face. In them, stitches, large calligraphy suls, Kufic
      writing patterns and flower bands are combined in the images, and they are
      made in a way that is unique to the monuments of Samarkand. It is this method
      that forms the Samarkand School of Architectural Decorations.\r\nThe tympanum
      at the top of the huge portico is remarkable: A red-gilt lion chasing a white
      lion. The sun is depicted as an almond-shaped, doe-eyed circle. His face is
      framed with gilded oil.\r\nThe whole composition is on a blue base, illustrated
      with turquoise and gold paints, and consists of intertwining branches and blooming
      white flowers. It is because of this wonderful image that he got the name \"Sherdar\",
      that is, \"Having Lions\", in classical Muslim astronomy, the presence of the
      sun in the sign of Asad, that is, on the Lion, is a sign of sad, that is, a
      happy time. From this, in the abjad calculation of this building: Yalangtosh
      - 816, Bahadir - 212, total 1028 hijri calculation, the origin of the number
      1619 in the melodic calculation is an indication that the construction of the
      Sherdar madrasa began in 1619.\r\nThe decorative decoration of the madrasa
      courtyard is as rich and varied as its outer walls. The names of the famous
      architects who created it - master Abdu Jabbar and the engraver and painter
      Avaz Samarkandi were also written on the inscriptions on the walls of the madrasa.\r\nOn
      the occasion of the 660th anniversary of the owner Amir Temur, a lot of work
      was done on the restoration of the southern and eastern facades of the building,
      two towers, the main facade, the arch of the porch, and the conservation of
      the inner courtyard.\r"
