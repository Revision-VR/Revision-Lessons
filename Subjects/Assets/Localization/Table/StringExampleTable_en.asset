      on the climatic conditions.\r\nThe average atmospheric pressure on Earth is
      1.01 bar, and the atmosphere is conditionally divided into layers that differ
      in density, temperature and composition: troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere,
      thermosphere, ionosphere, exosphere.\r\nAlmost 71% of the surface of our planet
      is occupied by oceans.\r\nContinents contain rivers, lakes, groundwater and
      ice, which together with the world's oceans form the hydrosphere.\r\nOn land,
      mountains, deserts, plains, plateaus and other types of relief are distinguished.\r\nThe
      Earth's poles are covered by a crust that includes the Arctic sea ice and the
      Antarctic ice sheet.\r\nThe Earth was formed from the solar nebula about 4.5
      billion years ago, and it ranks first among the 8 planets in terms of lithosphere
      density.\r\nEarth's magnetic field is one of the strongest in the solar system
      and protects our planet from solar plasmas and harmful radiation.\r\n"

      distance of 384,400 km from the Earth and has an average radius of 1,738 km.
      On average, the sun goes around the earth once every 27.3 days, passing through
      all its phases.

      The surface of the forest consists of gray silicate
      sands, calcid dust, and metals such as iron, aluminum and titanium are found
      in the soil composition. its albedo, i.e. reflectivity, reflects only 7.3%
      of sunlight.

      Tulin Oi is 465,000 times fainter than the Sun.

      Earth''s
      gravity slows down the game''s rotation around its axis. The period of one
      full rotation of the Oy around its axis is called the synodic Oy, and it is
      30 days, so people see only one side of the Oy.

      The natural satellite
      of the Earth was observed for the first time in 1610 by Galileo through a telescope.
      In 1647, the first map of Oi was created.

      The topography consists of
      plains below the general level, buttes, ravines, craters left by the impact
      of mountains and meteorites.

      A new stage of exploration of the game
      begins with the meeting of interplanetary automatic stations in the game. A
      lot of information about the moon was obtained with the help of such devices
      as "Lunar Orbiter", "Surveyor", "Apollo" and Lunokhod.

      In 1969, the
      members of the Apollo 11 mission were able to successfully return from Earth''s
      natural satellite. Until 1972, five more expeditions to Oi were organized,
      and a total of 12 astronauts returned to the surface of Oi.

      Every 29
      days, 12 hours and 44 minutes, the Full Moon occurs, and this cycle is called
      the Lunar Moon, and the Lunar Calendar was created based on this.

      moons of Mars are not spherical like our moon, but symmetrical in shape, reminiscent
      of large boulders or asteroids.\r\nMars has a thin atmosphere. According to
      scientists, in the distant past, the magnetic field of Mars weakened and lost
      a large part of the planet's atmosphere.\r\nThe Martian landscape consists
      of impact craters, volcanoes, valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps.\r\nAccording
      to NASA, the average temperature on the planet's surface is minus 60 degrees
      Celsius. Under the influence of sunlight, the surface temperature at the Martian
      equator can rise to plus 35 degrees. However, this warming loses its power
      as the sun's declination changes, and even on the hottest summer days for Mars,
      the temperature drops to minus 72 in the evenings.\r\nThe average distance

      That means 9 and a half times the distance from the earth to the sun.

      Saturn
      differs from other planets in the size of its rings. Like Jupiter, Saturn is
      a gas giant with an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. The lithosphere is composed
      of ice and silicates and has a relatively small core in the center. Saturn''s
      rings are 99 percent ice, and the rings are 250,000 kilometers in diameter

      the group of ice giants. Currently, Uranus is known to have 27 natural moons.
      Around Uranus, particles consisting of a mixture of ice and an unknown substance
      move in several parallel orbits, forming rings like Saturn. However, it is
      this unknown substance that gives the rings of Uranus a dark color, making
      it difficult to see and study.

      Like the gas giants of the Solar System,
      Uranus has a strong magnetosphere. The average distance from Uranus to the
      Sun is 2.8 billion kilometers, which is 18.6 times greater than the distance
      between the Earth and the Sun.

      Uranus''s average orbital speed is 6.81
      kilometers per second, and the planet orbits the Sun approximately once every
      84 Earth years.

      Uranus is the coldest planet in the Solar System, with
      a minimum temperature of minus 224 degrees Celsius.

      "Voyager 2" found
      its own magnetic field in Uranus. The atmosphere of Uranus consists of hydrogen,
      helium and 3 percent methane, and the wind speed on the surface of the planet
      can reach 900 kilometers per hour.

      Uranus can be directly observed from
      the ground in a very clear and dark sky. It was discovered to be a planet in
      1781 by the English astronomer William Herschel. So far, Uranus has been observed
      21 times, but astronomers mistook it for a star.

      The planet Uranus was
      studied by the Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1986.

      The names of the moons
      of Uranus were chosen from the names of characters in the works of William
      Shakespeare and Alexander Pope.

      of this ice giant from the Sun is 4 billion 55 million kilometers, or 30.3
      astronomical units.

      Around Neptune there is a system of extremely thin
      rings of ice and silicon salts, which can only be seen with high-resolution
      telescopes.

      Like the gas giants of the Solar System, Neptune has a strong
      magnetosphere. The planet''s atmosphere is composed of hydrogen, helium, and
      methane, with a mantle composed of water, ammonia, and methane ice; has a rock
      and ice core.

      Neptune has a red ring system with 5 components.

      Neptune''s
      average orbital speed is nearly 5.5 kilometers per second, and the planet orbits
      the Sun approximately once every 165 Earth years.

      The temperature in
      the upper layer of the planet''s atmosphere, which consists of huge ice and
      gas, is -220 degrees. Neptune is 49,244 kilometers in diameter, 3.9 times the
      size of Earth, and the fourth largest planet in the Solar System.

      The
      average density of Neptune is 1.64 (1 whole, 64 hundredths) grams per cubic
      centimeter.

      The mass is 1.02 x 1026 (1 whole hundred times 2 times 10
      to the 26th power) in kilograms.

      Neptune''s atmosphere consists of hydrogen,
      helium and methane.

      Neptune''s atmosphere has some of the strongest
      winds of any planet in the Solar System, with speeds estimated to reach 2,100
      kilometers per hour.

      The weather on Neptune consists of a system of
      storms, with winds reaching speeds greater than the speed of sound.

      It
      is not possible to directly see the planet Neptune from the earth. Neptune
      was discovered by scientists of the Berlin Observatory in 1846 through mathematical
      calculations.

      Neptune was approached only once in August 1989 by the
      Voyager 2 spacecraft. Through observations in the radio wave range, it has
      been proven that the planet is exposed to constant radiation and constant explosions
      occur on its surface.

      Neptune can only be seen from Earth using special
      observation devices.

    m_Localized: "The heart is the central organ of the circulatory system consisting
      of muscle tissue. By contracting and relaxing in a certain rhythm, the heart
      ensures that blood is transported through the veins to the various organs.
      The human heart is four-chambered, consisting of two chambers and two ventricles.\r\n\rThe
      circulatory system is divided into small and large circulatory system.\r\nA
      small circle of blood circulation connects the heart and lungs . Venous blood
      saturated with carbon dioxide from the right ventricle of the heart goes to
      the lungs through two pulmonary veins, where it is separated into capillaries.
      Carbon dioxide is removed in the capillaries, and the blood is again saturated
      with oxygen. Oxygenated blood comes to the left side of the heart through the
      artery. In this way, 1 movement cycle of the small circulatory system is completed.\r\nThe
      large circulatory system starts from the large left ventricle of the heart.
      The left ventricle pumps oxygenated blood into the aorta. Oxygenated blood
      travels throughout the body from the aorta to the arteries.\r\nBlood passes
      through the increasingly smaller and branching veins into the capillaries.
      The capillary transports the blood to the desired point. In the capillary,
      it gives the oxygen contained in the blood to the cells, saturates them with
      carbon dioxide, turns into venous blood and comes to the right side of the
      heart through the veins. In this way, 1 cycle of the large circulatory system
      is completed.\r\nVenous blood passes through the heart valves from the right
      ventricle to the right ventricle, moves towards the lungs with the contraction
      of the ventricle, and begins to move along the aforementioned small blood circulation
      circle.\r\nIn order to maintain the vital activity of the body, blood is in
      constant motion within both circulations.\r\n"

    m_Localized: 'The lung is a respiratory organ that fills both sides of the rib
      cage . Through the alveoli of the lungs, the oxygen in the air goes to the
      blood, and the carbon dioxide in the blood goes to the air. Through lung activity,
      the blood in the capillaries connected to the alveoli is enriched with oxygen
      and spreads throughout the body.

    m_Localized: "The active moving part of the human body are muscles , which contract
      and expand under the influence of nerve impulses . \r\nThe muscular system
      is divided into smooth, transverse and cardiac muscles. A muscle cell has a
      long filamentous shape. Muscles need a good blood supply to function properly.
      Because of this, small blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, and sensory and motor
      nerve tissue pass between the muscle tissues.\r\nSmooth muscles are the muscles
      of internal organs, skin, blood vessels and lymphatic vessels, which move involuntarily.
      For example, the muscles of the stomach contract and ensure the movement of
      food towards the intestine.\r\n\rTransverse muscles extend from the tendons
      and, together with ligaments and fascia, help the body move. Cross-sectional
      muscles are connected to bones and bone joints and move voluntarily.\r\nThe
      heart muscle - the myocardium performs absorption and delivery of blood .\r\nMuscle
      strength depends on the number of muscle fibers - myofibrils. There are about
      600 muscles in the human body, which are controlled by the central nervous
      system.\r\nThe human body has the following muscles:\r\nHead:\r\nForehead muscles\r\nTemplar
      muscles\r\nOral sphincter\r\nSkula\r\nEyelid muscles\r\nNeck:\r\nNeck triangle\r\nTrapezius
