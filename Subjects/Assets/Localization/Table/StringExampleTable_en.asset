      sixth period of the seventh group of the periodic table, sequence number -
      75. Rhenium is a silvery, malleable, sometimes dark gray heavy metal. It is
      second only to Tungsten in terms of resistance to high temperatures. The melting
      point is 3182 degrees Celsius.

      The relative atomic weight is 186.2
      (186 whole 2 of 10). Valence is from 1 to 7.

      Due to its resistance
      to cysts and alkalis, as well as temperature resistance, stable isotopes, rhenium
      is used to create protective layers of metals from external influences, in
      electrical engineering and in making devices that work in extreme conditions.

      10%
      of the world''s rhenium is mined annually in Uzbekistan.

      The third period in Mendeleev''s table is group 17 - halogens, toxic substances.
      Atomic number is 17. N relative atomic weight is equal to 35. Chlorine was
      created for the first time by the Swedish scientist Chlor Scheele by oxidizing
      chloric acid with manganese.

      Under normal conditions, it is a diatomic
      gas.

      A strong oxidizing gas with a pungent smell, yellow-green color,
      2.5 (2 whole 10 to 5) heavier than air. It dissolves well in cold and medium
      temperature water. In compounds -1, +1, +2, +3, +4, +5 and +7 valences appear.
      Hydrochloric acid is widely used in industry and laboratories.

      Another
      compound of chlorine is sodium chloride, called "table salt", and it is an
      essential element for life, excreting 0.25 (0.25 out of 100) percent of the
      human body. Chloride solution in water is used to disinfect rooms and objects.
      Respiratory and skin protection should be used when coming into contact with
